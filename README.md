## Explain the fundamental concepts of version control and why GitHub is a popular tool for managing versions of code. How does version control help in maintaining project integrity?

Version control is a sophisticated system that tracks and manages changes to files over time, particularly crucial in software development. At its core, version control serves as a time machine for your code, allowing you to:

1. Track Changes:
   - Record who made what changes and when
   - Document why changes were made through commit messages
   - Maintain a complete history of modifications

2. Collaboration Features:
   - Multiple developers can work simultaneously
   - Changes can be merged systematically
   - Conflicts can be resolved methodically

GitHub's Popularity stems from:
- Intuitive web interface
- Robust security features
- Extensive integration capabilities
- Large community and ecosystem
- Advanced collaboration tools
- CI/CD pipeline support
- Free hosting for open-source projects

Project Integrity is maintained through:
- Backup and redundancy
- Change validation and review processes
- Rollback capabilities
- Branch protection rules
- Automated testing integration
- Detailed audit trails
- Access control and permissions
